# Selectors

Selectors provide a way to create derived states. They can be created with the same `atom` function. There is one difference: selectors should have a `get` method that will run whenever any of the states they are subscribed to changes.

```jsx copy
import { atom, useAtom, useValue } from 'atomic-state'

const todosState = atom({
  key: 'todos',
  default: []
})

const completedTodosState = atom({
  key: 'completedTodos',
  get({ get }) {
    // This selector will re-render only when 'todosState' changes.
    // You can check that by adding a console.log :)

    const todos = get(todosState)

    return todos.filter((todo) => todo.completed)
  }
})

function CompletedTodos() {
  // Type is inferred here
  const completedTodos = useValue(completedTodosState)

  return <p>Completed todos: {todos.length}</p>
}
```

<Callout>
  Because selectors depend on other atoms' states, their state cannot be set
  manually. This also means that `actions` don't work inside them
</Callout>

They can also return promises:

```jsx filename="@/states/index.jsx" copy
import { atom } from 'atomic-state'

const textState = atom({
  key: 'text',
  default: ''
})

const searchResultsState = atom({
  key: 'searchResults',
  default: [],
  async get({ get }) {
    const text = get(textState)

    return fetch('/search?q=' + text).then((res) => res.json())
  }
})
```

<Callout>
  Note that in this case the result of the selector is a promise, so it will not
  be available while it's resolving. In that case, `default` is required. The
  return type will be inferred from it as well.
</Callout>

They can also subscribe to other selectors:

```jsx copy
import { atom } from 'atomic-state'

import { searchResultsState } from '@/states'

const infoState = atom({
  key: 'info',
  default: {
    name: '',
    searchResults: []
  },
  async get({ get }) {
    const searchResults = await get(searchResultsState)

    return {
      name: '',
      searchResults
    }
  }
})
```
